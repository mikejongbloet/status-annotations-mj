# Status annotations
A Figma plugin for adding a status annotations to your frames.

The plugin ships with 5 status annotations:
1. In progress — _For early explorations, or work in progress designs_
2. Review — _Needs review from a stakeholder or in a design crit_
3. Approved — _Design direction is approved, but may need minor tightening/tweaks for developers_
4. Develop — _Ready for developers to implement_
5. Complete — _design has been build and shipped_

## Forking your own version
The default status annotations may not apply to every team's workflow, so a secondary goal of this plugin was to make it easy to customize with your own annotations. Here is how to get setup.

### 1. Fork this repository 
Fork or clone this repository. You can also use the the following command:
```bash
npx degit thomas-lowry/status-annotations my-status-annotations
```

### 2. Install
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Develop
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Customize
The plugin UI is built using Svelte for the UI, but if you aren't familiar with Svelte, there isn't much you have to know or do! To start configuring the annotations, open `PluginUI.svelte` in your code editor.

First you will need to import your SVG icons. You can save them to the `src/assets` directory. I have designed each icon on a 12×12 frame.
```Javascript
import iconStatusA from './assets/icon-status-a.svg';
import iconStatusB from './assets/icon-status-b.svg';
```

Now that you have your icons imported, you need to edit the statuses array. You can add as many as you like, the plugin UI will resize to accommodate the number of statuses that you create. 
```Javascript
let statuses = [
  {
    'title': 'Status name A', //this is the name of the status
    'icon': iconStatusA, //this is the var which contains your SVG icon above
    'color': '#E93940' //this is the unique color for your annotation
  },
  {
    'title': 'Status name B', //this is the name of the status
    'icon': iconStatusB, //this is the var which contains your SVG icon above
    'color': '#E93940' //this is the unique color for your annotation
  }
];
```

### 5. Build
Next, you can build your plugin for use in production.
```bash
npm run build
```

### 6. Add to Figma
Lastly, you need to add your plugin to Figma. From your list of plugins, under the "In Development" header, choose "Create new Plugin" by clicking the + button. From here you want to point to the `public/manifest.json` file in your plugin directory. You can now run the plugin and test it out.

### 7. Publish privately (optional)
If you are part of a Figma Organization tier-plan, you can publish the plugin privately for use on your team.
